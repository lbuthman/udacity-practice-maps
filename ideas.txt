1. Create a pizza explorer. Use a homebase location, search for pizza places
in the location, and mark visited places. This lets me explore while not
visiting the same place twice. I can also use my own rating system, since I
trust my tastes more than other people.

2. Similar idea from above but just record all the places I have gone out to
eat at. The rating is simple binary: "I'd go there again." or "Nah.".
